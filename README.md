- **Engineering:** Curated and structured a high-fidelity dataset of 31,102 verses.
- **Goal:** Enabling specialized LLM fine-tuning through advanced sequence modeling.
- **Availability:** Open-sourced on [Kaggle](YOUR_KAGGLE_LINK) and [Hugging Face](YOUR_HF_LINK).
- **Proof of Concept:** Demonstrates my ability to manage complex ETL pipelines for large-scale Transformer training.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Expert), C++, LaTeX
- **Frameworks:** JAX/Flax (DeepMind Stack), PennyLane, Cirq, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Optimization:** XLA, Optax, Catalyst (Hybrid Quantum-Classical JIT)
- **Math:** Currently advancing in AP Calculus and Quantum Dynamics for QML.

## 🎓 Qualifications
- **B.Sc. in Computer Science** - **Mission:** Building AI systems that support human emotional growth and environmental sustainability.
