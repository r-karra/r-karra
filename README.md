## 🔭 Research Focus: GSoC 2026
I am currently a GSoC 2026 Candidate for **ML4Sci**, focusing on the **Quantum Particle Transformer (Q-ParT)**. My research objective is to replace classical Attention mechanisms with **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)** to improve signal detection in High Energy Physics.

## 📊 Highlighted Project: KJV-Bible-LLM Dataset
- **Engineering:** Curated and structured a high-fidelity dataset of 31,102 verses.
- **Goal:** Enabling specialized LLM fine-tuning through advanced sequence modeling.
- **Availability:** Open-sourced on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeshkumarkarra/), [GitHub](https://github.com/r-karra) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/r-karra).
- **Proof of Concept:** Demonstrates my ability to manage complex ETL pipelines for large-scale Transformer training.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Expert), C++, LaTeX
- **Frameworks:** JAX/Flax (DeepMind Stack), PennyLane, Cirq, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Optimization:** XLA, Optax, Catalyst (Hybrid Quantum-Classical JIT)
- **Math:** Currently advancing in AP Calculus and Quantum Dynamics for QML.

## 🎓 Qualifications
- **B.Sc. in Computer Science** - **Mission:** Building AI systems that support human emotional growth and environmental sustainability.
